# Pizza Sales Dashboard – Power BI & SQL Project
This project showcases an end-to-end Pizza Sales Dashboard built using Power BI as the visualization tool and SQL Server as the backend database for data storage, management, and query processing.

# Project Overview :-
The primary objective is to analyze pizza sales data and present actionable business insights through an interactive dashboard. The entire workflow involves:

Importing and structuring the pizza sales dataset in SQL Server

Creating and optimizing SQL queries for key business questions

Developing a visually compelling and interactive dashboard in Power BI by connecting directly to the SQL Server database

# Key Features of the Dashboard :-
# Total Revenue, Pizzas Sold, and Orders:
Instantly view major KPIs like revenue (₤817.86K), total pizzas sold (50,000), number of orders (21,000), average order value (₤38.31), and average pizzas per order (2.32).

# Sales Trends:
Analyze daily and monthly order trends. The dashboard highlights peak order days—Friday and Saturday evenings—as well as high-performing months like July and January.

# Best & Worst Sellers:
Drill into the top and bottom performing pizzas based on revenue, quantity sold, and total orders. For example, the Thai Chicken Pizza leads in revenue, while the Classic Deluxe Pizza tops quantity and order volume.

# Category & Size Analysis:
Visualize sales breakdowns by pizza category (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, Chicken) and pizza size (L, M, S, XL, XXL). Large pizzas and the Classic category are top contributors to revenue and sales volume.

# Technologies Used :-
# SQL Server:
Data storage, normalization, and advanced querying for extracting insights from large sales data.

# Power BI:
Data visualization and dashboard design, leveraging direct SQL connectivity for real-time analysis.

# How it Works
# Data Integration:
Sales data, including order details and product attributes, are imported and managed in SQL Server.

# Data Analysis with SQL:
Complex queries calculate KPIs, segment sales by category/size, and generate trends used by Power BI.

# Power BI Dashboard:
The visual layer pulls live data using custom SQL queries, delivering performance monitoring and strategic insights via interactive charts, bar graphs, and KPIs.

# 2  PROJECTB ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

I created a interactive dashboard regarding Road Accident Analysis.

# Steps involved :

Extracting the data from Kaggle.
Transforming the data in Power Query in Power BI.
Loading it in the Power BI and creating dashboard using various charts and DAX queries.
# DESCRIPTION :
Accident Analysis & Prevention provides wide coverage of the general areas relating to accidental injury and damage, including the pre-injury and immediate post-injury phases.

# TOOLS USED : 
Power BI To analyze, I did data cleaning in Power Query, used Time intelligence Function/ Calendar Date Table in Power BI, Data Modelling(Relationship between multiple tables) , YTD and Y0Y Growth Calculations using DAX, KPI and Advanced Generations, Created Custom columns and measures in the reports, Import Images.

# AREAS TO BE ANALYSED :

Primary KPI- Total Casualties and Total Accident values for Current Year and YoY growth.
Primary KPI- Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth.
Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for current Year.
Monthly trend showing comparison of casualties for Current Year and Previous Year.
Casualties by Road Type for Current year.
Current Year Casualties by Area/Location & by Day/ Night
